# Installation
Requires BepInEx to load the plugin.
Place LargeInventory.dll inside BepInEx/plugins folder.

I personally use ValheimPlus mod which comes with BepInEx bundled and just add my dll to BepInEx/plugins folder.

# Warning
* When removing the mod, items in the removed slots will be lost
* Use at your own risk
